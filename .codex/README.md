## Rulebook Requirement

All Codex tasks must consult `docs/GROOKAI_RULEBOOK.md` before making changes. This rulebook consolidates every contract, guardrail, and workflow for Grookai Vault, and Codex must treat it as authoritative guidance on migrations, backend architecture, ingestion, pricing, environments, secrets, and forbidden moves.
