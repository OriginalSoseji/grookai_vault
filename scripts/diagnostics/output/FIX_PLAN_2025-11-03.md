# Fix Plan — Nov 3, 2025 (follow-ups)

Owner: Cesar

- Retries/backoff for external fetches (PTCG/eBay/JustTCG)
  - Add 2 retries with exponential backoff around `fetchWithTimeout` where we call third‑party APIs.
  - Files: `supabase/functions/*` that hit external endpoints.
- Surface `pricing_alerts_v` in DEV overlay/UI (health banner)
  - Add a small overlay card in `lib/features/dev/dev_health_page.dart` consuming `pricing_alerts_v` via a new service.
- Wall feed images strategy
  - Decide on thumbnail generation/storage; once available, recreate `public.wall_feed_v` with `thumb_url` and drop full-size URL.
- Extend projections
  - Audit remaining `.select('*')` usages and replace with minimal projections in hot paths.
- Index review
  - Validate query plans for price lookups and wall feed; adjust or add covering indexes if needed.
